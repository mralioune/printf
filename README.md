0x11. C - printf team project 
This is a team project by Favour simeon and  El hadji Alioune Ndiaye is a custom made printf function written 100% in C, called _printf. The function is optimized to take various inputs and optional arguments exactly the way standard library function printf works. In this case we can say we built our own printf.
